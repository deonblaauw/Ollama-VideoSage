  "final_description": "A person demonstrates a series of tasks involving two bottles and a pipette set-up. They start by showing the two bottles on a table, then proceed to unscrew the cap of a larger bottle. The individual uses a pipette to draw liquid from the larger bottle, then transfers it to a smaller bottle. They continue by preparing another pipette, carefully measuring and transferring liquid between the bottles, ensuring accuracy as they work. Throughout the process, they also handle caps and equipment while maintaining focus on the measurements and transfers."
