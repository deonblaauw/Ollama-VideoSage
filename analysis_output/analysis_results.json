  "final_description": "A person demonstrates a laboratory procedure involving two bottles and a pipette. They first show the bottles, then handle the larger one, tightening its cap. Next, they prepare to use a pipette, adjusting it and selecting a straw-like attachment. The individual uses the pipette to draw liquid from one bottle and measure it. They pour the liquid into the smaller bottle. The process includes careful handling and measurement, ensuring accuracy throughout the demonstration. Finally, the person inspects the filled smaller bottle, showing the completed task."
